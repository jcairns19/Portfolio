        "description": "I first started building out this NAS back in late 2020 with the goal of centralizing my family’s large library of music CDs, photos, and videos we’ve collected over the years to a storage device detached from the cloud. Learning Linux and exploring networking and security were also curiosities of mine at the time. The first iteration of this machine was a simple Linux desktop computer with a couple hard drives accessible to the local network for basic NAS functions. At this point I began exploring running open-source services on the machine to give all of us more reasons to use it. Plex was where I started and I found it fascinating that I could listen to any track of mine anywhere I was on any device. From there, I began to experiment win any application that I thought was remotely useful to build up an impressive fleet of services which leads to the second and current iteration of the machine. Currently today, the system is running Unraid which is a NAS focused OS that has support for several storage array configurations wit redundant protections, docker containers, and KVM virtual machines. I have also expanded the system to a used enterprise server chassis that I found on eBay configured with 20 Xeon CPU cores, 48TB of memory, and a 20TB storage array. The system runs a variety of services including a fully automated Plex stack, Nextcloud, Jellyfin, GitLab, a full Bitcoin node, and more security and networking tools.",

The system has 10 Xeon cores, 128GB of memory and a 2TB drive in it for local storage. I run all of the game servers on the local disk for better performance but back them up over the network to my NAS machine for safe redundant storage. Today, the machine runs nearly 10 game server instances and is holding up strong.",
